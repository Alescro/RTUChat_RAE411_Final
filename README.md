# RTUChat_RAE411_Final

My Final Project during the course RAE411 "Telecommunications Software" at Riga Technical University 

# A RTU Chat
### Telecommunications Software Final Work

A simple online chat to be used between RTU Students with React and Firebase. 
Only 100 simultaneous connections limited due to low space on the free Trial of Firebase.

- Firebase User Authentification with Google accounts
- RealTime Data Streams using React Hooks
